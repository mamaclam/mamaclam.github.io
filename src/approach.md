      <h4>Depth-Oriented</h4>
      <p>
        Founded by Carl Jung, depth psychology seeks to understand the role of the unconscious through dreams, myths, symbols, images, art, and archetypes. By doing so, we tend to the wild soul within that longs to be heard.

      <h4>Somatic</h4>
      <p>
        Past trauma and stress imprint themselves on the nervous system, impacting how one responds to the world and people around them. By learning the language of the soma—the body—one can begin to access its essential wisdom.

      <h4>Existential</h4>
      <p>
        Existential psychology addresses the absurdity of what it means to be human, emphasizing the importance of our search for meaning, our relationship with the Self, our mortality, and our connections with others. By taking this approach, therapy can support the creation of meaning, even in the most challenging aspects of life.

      <h4>Relational</h4>
      <p>
        Research on psychotherapy consistently shows that the most critical factor for positive outcomes is the quality of the therapeutic relationship. I bring authenticity and devotion to my work with clients to foster a deep and genuine connection.
      </p>

      <h4>Attachment-Focused</h4>
      <p>
        Our early attachment experiences shape how we navigate relationships. A key part of therapy is understanding how growing up in our family of origin has shaped our relational patterns. By bringing awareness to these deeply ingrained tendencies, one can begin to heal and evolve them in service of themselves and their relationships.

      <h4>Psychoanalytic</h4>
      <p>
        In childhood, our psyche creates complex defense systems to keep us safe. However, as we grow into adulthood, these very defense mechanisms can obstruct the realization of our deepest desires. What was once adaptive becomes maladaptive. By examining these patterns, therapy can help the wise adult self take control of life.
