<h1>Good Faith Estimate</h1>
<p>You have the right to receive a “Good Faith Estimate” detailing the cost of your medical and mental health care. By law, healthcare providers must give an estimate of expected charges to patients without insurance or those not using insurance, including for psychotherapy services.</p>
<p>You have the right to receive a Good Faith Estimate for the total expected cost of any non-emergency healthcare services, including psychotherapy.</p>
<p>You can request a Good Faith Estimate from your healthcare provider, or any other provider you choose, before scheduling a service.</p>
<p>If you receive a bill that is at least $400 more than your Good Faith Estimate, you have the right to dispute the bill. Be sure to save a copy or picture of your Good Faith Estimate.</p>
