    <h1>I'm Alexandra,</h1>
    <p>
      an Associate Marriage and Family Therapist based in Ojai, California. I received my Master's degree in counseling psychology with a specialization in depth psychology from Pacifica Graduate Institute, following my Bachelor's degree in philosophy from UCLA. In addition to private practice, I work as a school-based therapist for the Ojai Unified School District, treating teenagers as they integrate back into post-pandemic life while supporting them in the ever-challenging journey of individuation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Through my own experiences of initiation, transformation, love, and loss, I was called to the path of psychotherapy to support others on their healing journey. I have greatly benefited from psychotherapy at different phases of my life and believe that the most effective therapy occurs within the container of a deeply meaningful and authentic connection with another person. I welcome you to reach out to discover if I may be that person for you.
