      <div class="quote-text">“UNTIL YOU MAKE THE UNCONSCIOUS CONSCIOUS, IT WILL DIRECT YOUR LIFE AND YOU WILL CALL IT <b><i>FATE</i></b>.”</div>

    <p>
      I believe that we are all on the brink of a threshold, a rite of passage that is calling us. I support individuals and couples in discovering what that threshold is and how to cross it. By taking a depth psychological approach, we explore the unconscious material of your psyche to understand what may be holding you back from realizing deeper layers of healing and wholeness.
    </p>
    <p>
      The human experience is defined by the tension of life and death, joy and suffering, and pleasure and pain. I believe that the work of therapy is to develop the skill of holding the tension of these opposites. Engaging in a conscious healing process supports one in accessing deeper layers of feeling that have previously felt unsafe or out of reach. By moving through suffering, we create an opportunity to deepen our capacity for the love, joy, pleasure, peace, and creativity that is available to us all.
    </p>
    <p>
      I create a warm and empathetic space for self-exploration grounded in authentic relationship. I take a solutions-focused approach, supporting each one of my clients in identifying what they desire from our time together and realizing their unique intentions and goals. This may take the form of exploring the past and how it impacts the present, examining relational patterns, developing coping skills, visioning your future, processing deep emotion, rewriting narratives, and cultivating a relationship with the wholeness of your being.

        Individual Therapy
      </h4>
      <p>
        I specialize in treating adolescents and adults who are struggling with anxiety, depression, relationship issues, grief and loss, life transitions, substance use, and those exploring their spirituality, sexuality, and sexual identity.

      <h4>
        Couples Therapy
      </h4>
      <p>
        As the renowned couples therapist Esther Perel famously says, “the quality of our life is determined by the quality of our relationships.” I support couples in transforming relational trauma, developing consciousness around relational patterns, and cultivating effective and compassionate communication skills to access deeper layers of intimacy. My work is informed by Stan Tatkin’s PACT method, Terry Real’s Relational Life Therapy, and the Gottman Method.

      <h4>
        Psychedelic Integration
      </h4>
      </p>
        Psychedelic medicine has the capacity to awaken unconscious material, deepen connection to one’s spiritual nature, and shift our perspective on what it means to be human. However, without integration, even the most profound psychedelic experiences lose their healing potential. Through my own transformative experiences with psychedelic medicine, as well as training in psychedelic integration, I provide support for those who wish to integrate their learnings and insights into their daily lives.
